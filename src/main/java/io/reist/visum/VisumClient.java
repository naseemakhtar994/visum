 * Visum helps you resolve two problems:
 * Construct an MVP architecture and organize inversion of control.
 * Hence it has two interfaces: VisumView and VisumClient.
 * </p><p>
 * VisumClient is an interfaces providing behavior for Views that has dependency injections.
 * Visum recommends following structure of application:
 * Views (usually it's an {@link android.app.Activity}, {@link android.app.Fragment} or {@link android.view.View})
 * have Presenters injected into them. Being recreated on orientation changed view itself looses all it data, except you save it manually with saveInstantState.
 * But presenter survives orientation change, which gives you a lot of afford not needing to reload big amounts of data.
 * "Magic!" - you say. Yeah. And all this magic happens in your implementation of {@link ComponentCache}
 * (checkout sample <a href="https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mvp-sandbox/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/io/reist/sandbox/app/SandboxComponentCache.java">SandboxComponentCache</a>).
 * </p><p>
 * To provide such cozy experience you need to have a Singleton Component and a Singleton Presenter.
 * Same component should be always provided into {@link VisumClient#inject(Object)} method for the same view.
 * Talking about the same view we mean more that same instance of a view. It's same view as a logical concept.
 * To easily distinguish same view from another view is just think about it as the same screen or just the same stuff.
 * Just make your view implement VisumClient and follow the interface.
 * </p>

 * Created by Reist on 10/15/15.
 * <p>
 * VisumPresenter is a class that handles attachment and detachment of a {@link io.reist.visum.view.VisumView}.
 * </p>
 * It's also empowered with rx steroids, which makes it handle your subscriptions
 * making you not to worry about android **Views** lifecycle.
 * All your rx subscriptions are to be unsubscribed on view detached.
 * Use {@link VisumPresenter#subscribe(Observable, Observer)} method to gain this benifits.
